Implemeting Actor-Critic
==========================================

The previous REINFORCE implementation can be easily adapted to actor-critic. The main differences are:
1) we just need to acquire N steps at each iteration (instead of complete episodes)
2) the loss will be using the temporal differences


The Batcher
-----------

Since we do not need to acquire complete episodes, we will use the simple `Batcher`:

.. code-block:: python

        #We create a batcher dedicated to evaluation

        self.train_batcher=Batcher(
            n_timesteps=self.config["a2c_timesteps"],
            n_slots=self.config["n_envs"]*self.config["n_threads"],
            create_agent=self._create_agent,
            create_env=self._create_env,
            env_args={
                "n_envs": self.config["n_envs"],
                "max_episode_steps": self.config["max_episode_steps"],
                "env_name":self.config["env_name"]
            },
            agent_args={"n_actions": self.n_actions, "model": model},
            n_threads=self.config["n_threads"],
            seeds=[self.config["env_seed"]+k*10 for k in range(self.config["n_threads"])],
        )

In our case, the batcher is configured to acquired `n_timesteps` steps at each call (instead of complete episodes).

It will work has follows:

1) at `reset`, the batcher will initialize `n_envs * n_threads` agents (one agent per environment)

.. code-block:: python

    self.train_batcher.reset(agent_info=agent_info)

2) at `execute`, the batcher will launch the acquisition of the `n_timesteps` steps

.. code-block:: python

            self.train_batcher.execute()
            trajectories=self.train_batcher.get(blocking=True)

3) at `get`, the batcher will return the acquired trajectories

.. code-block:: python

                if trajectories is None: #All the agents have finished their jobs on the previous episodes:
                #Then, reset  again to start new episodes
                n_episodes=self.config["n_envs"]*self.config["n_threads"]
                agent_info=DictTensor({"stochastic":torch.tensor([True]).repeat(n_episodes)})
                self.train_batcher.reset(agent_info=agent_info)
                self.train_batcher.execute()
                trajectories=self.train_batcher.get(blocking=True)


Note that, at each call, some of the `n_envs * n_threads` environments may be terminated. In that case, the batcher will only return trajectories over the running environments.
At last, if `get` returns `None`, it means that the `n_envs * n_threads` `n_envs * n_threads` have terminated, and the batcher has to be `reset` again.


Computing A2C loss
------------------

Now, the computation involved the computation of the critic value at all timestep of the acquired trajectory, but also at the last acquired observation.

The computation of the critic at each timestep can be computed as:

.. code-block:: python

            critic=[]
            for t in range(max_length):
                b=self.critic_model(trajectories["frame"][:,t])
                critic.append(b.unsqueeze(1))

We need one more space to compute the value at time `T+1` (or at the end of the episode if the episode is finishing in these trajectories)

.. code-block:: python

            critic=torch.cat(critic+[b.unsqueeze(1)],dim=1).squeeze(-1) #Now, we have a B x (T+1) tensor

            #We also need to compute the critic value at for the last observation of the trajectories (to compute the TD)
            # It may be the last element of the trajectories (if episode is not finished), or on the last frame of the episode
            idx=torch.arange(trajectories.n_elems())
            last_critic=self.critic_model(trajectories["_frame"][idx,trajectories.lengths-1]).squeeze(-1)
            critic[idx,trajectories.lengths]=last_critic


No, the following is similar to REINFORCE

Speeding-up A2C with Infinite Environments
------------------------------------------

In the previous version, when acquiring trajectories, some environments may be terminated. To avoid wasting time, we can auto-reset the terminated environment. This can be done very easily by using a `GymEnvInf` instead of a `GymEnv` in the `main` function.

.. code-block:: python

def create_env(n_envs, env_name=None, max_episode_steps=None, seed=None):
    envs=[]
    for k in range(n_envs):
        e = create_gym_env(env_name)
        e = TimeLimit(e, max_episode_steps=max_episode_steps)
        envs.append(e)
    return GymEnv(envs, seed)


def create_train_env(n_envs, env_name=None, max_episode_steps=None, seed=None):
    envs=[]
    for k in range(n_envs):
        e = create_gym_env(env_name)
        e = TimeLimit(e, max_episode_steps=max_episode_steps)
        envs.append(e)
    return GymEnvInf(envs, seed)
